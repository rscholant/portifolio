          In addition to being a mobile developer analyst, I'm very thirsty to
          learn and in my spare time I try to learn as much of new technologies
          as possible, participating in courses, workshops and lectures, so that
          with time I can be doing my job better and better.
        </p>

    </section>

export default Interests;
